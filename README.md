This repository contains an example of an uncommon error in Python: a `RecursionError` caused by a missing base case in a recursive function. The file `bug.py` shows the function with the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version with proper base case handling and exception handling. The error occurs because the recursive function does not have a defined stopping condition.  This leads to infinite recursion, resulting in a `RecursionError`.
